These conditions contributed to an early start to the wildfire season in Washington State. By June 9, 2025, the Red Bridge Fire near Cle Elum had burned 60 acres and led to immediate evacuations. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Washington_wildfires?utm_source=openai)) </text>
